_Competition entry for designing a college cafeteria website. Special mention for best-design._

INSTRUO – the annual technical fest of my alma mater (IIEST Shibpur) – came back with its web development competition WebD again in 2015. The problem statement was more challenging than [the previous year](https://nilavra.in/projects/instruo2015). The competition was restricted to undergraduate students only, and I was now an alumnus. Still, the web developer in me could not hold back. Though the organizers could not award me a position due to the policies, they did mention that my entry had the **best design**.
